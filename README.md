# Hello-World
Testing 
Just trying this out to see if I can help a friend.
I used to write straight HTML back in the bad old days, using NotePad!
We didn't have CSS or PHP back then.
Most of the people I knew then had never been on the Internet.
Things have changed a lot.
I still do website work with Dreamweaver and sometimes WordPress as editors.
I like using external CSS files for all my formatting.
I like to play with Python and Scratch.
